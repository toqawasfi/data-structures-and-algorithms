# Challenge Title
CC31: HashTable repeatedwoed
## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
[hashtable](./repeatedword.jpg)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The space complexity of the repeated_word function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the repeated_word function is O(n), where n is the length of the input strin

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
To run the code you have to pass an array and vlue to be inserted .
