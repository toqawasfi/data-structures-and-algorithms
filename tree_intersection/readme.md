# Challenge Title
CC32: intersection tree
## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
[hashtable](./intersection.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Time complexity : O(n1 + n2) # n1 and n2 are the number of nodes in tree1 and tree2

Space complexity : O(n)
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
To run the code you have to pass an array and vlue to be inserted .
