## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- Implemnting vertex,edge and graph classes.
- list will store the order of vertices visited
- function called dfs, which performs the depth-first traversal starting from the given vertex.

Time Com:O(V + E)
Space Com:O(V)
