## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
[hashtable](./hashtable.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
set(key, value):O(1) best case ,O(n) In the worst case

get(key): O(1) best case ,O(n) In the worst case

has(key): O(1) best case ,O(n) In the worst case

keys(): O(n)

hash(key): O(1)

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
To run the code you have to pass an array and vlue to be inserted .
