[Whiteboard2](./whiteboard2.jpg)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I used for loop and append tool to be able to add an element in the correct index without using insert tool
Time complexoty:O(n)
Space complexity :O(n)

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
To run the code you have to pass an array and vlue to be inserted .
