## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The code defines two classes: Node and LinkedList2.
The Node class has two instance variables: value and next.
The LinkedList2 class has an instance variable head which refers to the first node in the linked list.
The LinkedList2 class has three methods:
__str__ method returns a string representation of the linked list.
append method adds a new node to the end of the linked list.
insert_before method inserts a new node with a given value before a node with a specific value in the linked list.
insert_after method inserts a new node with a given value after a node with a specific value in the linked list.
